# ML_PBLE_6

The objective of this lab is to understand and apply the concepts of Support Vector Machines
(SVM), focusing on constructing and evaluating SVM models for both classification and
regression tasks. Students will learn to implement SVM using Python, train the models on
datasets, and evaluate their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision,
recall, F1-score, mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared.
